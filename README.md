 Project Title: Deep Learning Model for Image Classification/NLP

This project involves building a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The objective is to solve a real-world problem using either Image Classification or Natural Language Processing, along with visualizations for results.



 Tech Stack Used
	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow / PyTorch
	•	NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
	•	Scikit-learn (if used for preprocessing or evaluation)
 

 Features
	•	Implementation of a custom deep learning model
	•	Real-time data processing and predictions
	•	Visualization of training and testing results
	•	Classification report & confusion matrix (if applicable)
 
 ⚙️ How to Run the Project
	1.	Clone the repository or download the project folder.
	2.	Install the required dependencies:

 pip install -r requirements.txt

 3.	Open model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
	4.	Run the notebook cell by cell to train the model and visualize results.



 Model Results
	•	Training and validation accuracy plots
	•	Loss curves
	•	Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
	•	Confusion matrix for classification tasks



 Notes
	•	The project is flexible: you can implement Image Classification (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10) or Text Classification (e.g., Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection).
	•	Visualizations are necessary for demonstrating model performance clearly.
	•	Make sure to use a clean, modular, and commented code style.
